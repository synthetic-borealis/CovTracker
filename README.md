## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the the app on a mobile device.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page when supported by the device.
- Add their symptoms on a daily basis.
- View all interactive elements on a popup panel.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Java Script
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project we learned how some nifty UI tricks, such as how to create animated UI panels.

### Continued development

At some point in the future we'd like to convert this project to React (or a similar project), and perhaps turn it into a mobile application that can run outside of a browser.

### Useful resources

- [How to Create a Collapsible](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp) - This tutorial helped us a lot when it came to create the animated UI panels (with some adjustments to make it fit our needs for this project).
- [Vanilla Calendar](https://github.com/marssola/vanilla-calendar) - An open-source calendar library written in vanilla JavaScript & CSS that we initially planned to use in our project.
