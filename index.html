          Vitamin A nasal drops might be able to treat the loss or altered sense of smell in some people who have had
          Covid, UK researchers say.

        <p class="article__paragraph">
          The University of East Anglia is conducting a 12-week trial.

          Since I had Covid, food makes me want to vomit. Covid smell loss made meat taste like petrol. Loss or
          altered sense of smell is a common symptom of Covid, although many other viruses, such as flu, can also cause
          it.

        <p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph_gap-size_small">
          And while most people naturally regain it within a couple of weeks, many have been left with continuing smell

          Children in the UK aged 12 to 15 are set to be able to get a Covid jab, following advice from the UK's chief
          medical officers.
        </p>

          They have recommended the youngsters should be offered one dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Some other countries have been vaccinating younger teenagers for some time - but approaches do differ.

          Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision
          Covid: Which children are being vaccinated and why?
        </p>

        <h3 class="article__subtitle">What's happening in Europe?</h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          In May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the Pfizer vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds. Since then,
          different EU countries have moved at different speeds.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Denmark (12 to 15-year-olds) and Spain (12 to 19-year-olds) have both now vaccinated most of their child
          population with at least a single dose.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          France too has been moving quickly with 66% of those aged 12 to 17 now single jabbed, and 52% fully
          vaccinated. By October the country's health pass - or pass sanitaire - will be extended to under-18s, meaning
          all teenagers will need to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test to access places like cinemas,
          museums, restaurants and indoor shopping centres.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          In June Germany's scientific advisers recommended the vaccine should only be offered to children aged 12 to 15
          with underlying health conditions. But in August, after the Delta variant started spreading more widely, the
          rollout was extended to all those over 12 years old.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          In Sweden children aged 12 to 15 are only eligible for a vaccine if they have lung disease, severe asthma or
          another high-risk medical condition. In Norway, not part of the EU, the vaccine rollout was recently extended
          to children aged 12 to 15, but only a first dose will be offered, with a decision on a second dose to be made
          later.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          The US - some mandatory vaccination
          In May, US and Canadian regulators were the first to approve the Pfizer jab for use in children from 12 years
          and older. The rollout started immediately at sites across the US with two injections given three weeks apart.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          By the end of July, 42% of 12 to 17-year-olds had received their first dose and 32% their second dose of
          either the Pfizer or Moderna shots.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          The drive to vaccinate children came as the US started to battle a rise in infections driven by the Delta variant.
