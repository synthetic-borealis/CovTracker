          Vitamin A nasal drops might be able to treat the loss or altered sense of smell in some people who have had
          Covid, UK researchers say.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          The University of East Anglia is conducting a 12-week trial.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Only some of the volunteer patients will receive the treatment but all will be asked to sniff powerful odours
          such as rotten eggs and roses.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          And brain scans will check if the vitamin has repaired injured olfactory pathways or "smell nerves".
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Since I had Covid, food makes me want to vomit. Covid smell loss made meat taste like petrol. Loss or
          altered sense of smell is a common symptom of Covid, although many other viruses, such as flu, can also cause
          it.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph_gap-size_small">
          And while most people naturally regain it within a couple of weeks, many have been left with continuing smell
          disorders.

          Simple things such as showering or brushing her teeth are also unpleasant because of her skewed sense of
          smell.

          But the situation has improved gradually and Lina has found a few life hacks that help.

          "Adding lemon or chilli to foods can make them smell better," she says.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          "I also experimented and made lists of safe foods that would not make me want to vomit.

          I had to be creative about it to make sure I was eating enough of the right things to stay well."

        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Lead researcher Prof Carl Philpott, from UEA's Norwich Medical School and James Paget University Hospitals NHS
          Trust, said: "We want to find out whether there is an increase in the size and activity of damaged smell
          pathways in patients' brains when they are treated with vitamin-A nasal drops.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          "We will look for changes in the size of the olfactory bulb - an area above the nose where the smell nerves
          join together and connect to the brain.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          "We will also look at activity in areas of the brain linked to recognising smells."
