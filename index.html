          Vitamin A nasal drops might be able to treat the loss or altered

          say.

        <p class="article__paragraph">
          The University of East Anglia is conducting a 12-week trial.

        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Only some of the volunteer patients will receive the treatment but
          all will be asked to sniff powerful odours such as rotten eggs and
          roses.

          And brain scans will check if the vitamin has repaired injured

          Since I had Covid, food makes me want to vomit. Covid smell loss
          made meat taste like petrol. Loss or altered sense of smell is a
          common symptom of Covid, although many other viruses, such as flu,
          can also cause it.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph_gap-size_small">
          And while most people naturally regain it within a couple of weeks,
          many have been left with continuing smell disorders.

          Children in the UK aged 12 to 15 are set to be able to get a Covid jab, following advice from the UK's chief
          medical officers.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          They have recommended the youngsters should be offered one dose of the Pfizer vaccine.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Some other countries have been vaccinating younger teenagers for some time - but approaches do differ.

          Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision
          Covid: Which children are being vaccinated and why?
        </p>

        <h3 class="article__subtitle">What's happening in Europe?</h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          In May, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the Pfizer vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds. Since then,
          different EU countries have moved at different speeds.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Denmark (12 to 15-year-olds) and Spain (12 to 19-year-olds) have both now vaccinated most of their child
          population with at least a single dose.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          France too has been moving quickly with 66% of those aged 12 to 17 now single jabbed, and 52% fully
          vaccinated. By October the country's health pass - or pass sanitaire - will be extended to under-18s, meaning
          all teenagers will need to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test to access places like cinemas,
          museums, restaurants and indoor shopping centres.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          In June Germany's scientific advisers recommended the vaccine should only be offered to children aged 12 to 15
          with underlying health conditions. But in August, after the Delta variant started spreading more widely, the
          rollout was extended to all those over 12 years old.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          In Sweden children aged 12 to 15 are only eligible for a vaccine if they have lung disease, severe asthma or
          another high-risk medical condition. In Norway, not part of the EU, the vaccine rollout was recently extended
          to children aged 12 to 15, but only a first dose will be offered, with a decision on a second dose to be made
          later.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          The US - some mandatory vaccination
          In May, US and Canadian regulators were the first to approve the Pfizer jab for use in children from 12 years
          and older. The rollout started immediately at sites across the US with two injections given three weeks apart.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          By the end of July, 42% of 12 to 17-year-olds had received their first dose and 32% their second dose of
          either the Pfizer or Moderna shots.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          The drive to vaccinate children came as the US started to battle a rise in infections driven by the Delta
          variant.

        <img src="./images/pictures/mustafa-omar-WQUWCcDO8uI-unsplash.jpg" alt="A masked woman"
          class="article__picture">
        <p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph_gap-size_small">
          Overall, more mask use is a good thing, according to doctors: "Wearing a mask helps prevent respiratory
          droplets from spreading as far as they otherwise would without a mask,” says Lisa M. Lee, PhD, a public health
          expert specializing in infectious disease epidemiology and public health ethics at Virginia Tech. “If a person
          has a respiratory infection—in this case, SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19—breathing, coughing, and sneezing
          can spew droplets that travel six to 14 feet away. Wearing a mask reduces the amount of space these droplets
          travel and will help prevent transmission,” she explains.
        </p>

        <h3 class="article__subtitle">Another important reminder about masks: </h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          They work best when everyone wears one (that means, you protect others when you wear a mask, and vice-versa).
          So while mask-wearing may appear to be a personal choice, your decision to don one is a step you can take for
          the health of your community.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph_gap-size_small">
          Mask-wearing policies still vary by state—as do social distancing guidelines—so there isn't always a clear
          answer as to when you need to wear a mask during specific situations, like when you're in your car or when you
          go for a run. To help clear things up, Health asked three different infectious disease or public health
          experts for their takes on the best public health practices regarding wearing face masks right now, during
          specific situations, regardless of where you live.

        <h3 class="article__subtitle">Myth 1: Hand dryers can kill the new coronavirus</h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          This was a myth that started early in the pandemic, and it's still not true, says the WHO.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph_gap-size_small">
          The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is to wash your hands frequently (or clean them with an
          alcohol-based hand rub), then dry them thoroughly with paper towels or a warm air dryer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="article__subtitle">Myth 2: An ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the new coronavirus</h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph_gap-size_small">
          So, it's true that some hospitals use UV light to kill microbes on surfaces—like in operating rooms or
          labs—but, per the WHO, UV lamps should never be used to sterilize hands or skin, as they can cause skin
          irritation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="article__subtitle">Myth 3: Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people infected with the new
          coronavirus</h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          This one's twofold: While thermal scanners can detect fevers (aka, a higher than normal body temperatures) in
          those infected with the coronavirus, they cannot detect the infection in those who are not yet showing
          symptoms. "This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and
          develop a fever," the WHO explains.
        </p>

          Also important to note: The flu also causes similar symptoms to COVID-19, including a fever—so just because
          someone has a fever doesn't necessarily mean they've been infected with the new coronavirus.

        <h3 class="article__subtitle">Myth 4: Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body can kill the new
          coronavirus</h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph_gap-size_small">
          While spraying alcohol and chlorine is a great method to disinfect surfaces—and even using an alcohol-based
          hand sanitizer can help keep your hands clean—using the chemicals all over your body isn't going to kill the
          virus if you've already been infected. "Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes
          (i.e. eyes, mouth)," the WHO points out.
        </p>

        <h3 class="article__subtitle">Myth 5: It isn't safe to receive a letter or a package from China</h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus
          can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international
          mail, products, or packaging, says the CDC. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by
          touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
          their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">
          Believing and spreading the message that it's not safe to get something through the mail from China is harmful
          because it helps perpetuate the stigmatization of specific populations linked to COVID-19. This stigma—which
          can force people to hide their illnesses, prevent people from getting health care immediately, and discourage
          people from following healthy behaviors—can lead to more severe health problems and ongoing transmission, per
          the WHO.
